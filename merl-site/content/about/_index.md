# Welcome to the Multidisciplinary Educational Robotics Lab (MERL) at Rose-Hulman!  

At **MERL**, we design **inclusive, open-source robotics platforms** that make engineering education hands-on, affordable, and accessible to everyone.  

Led by [**Dr. Carlotta A. Berry**](https://wordpress.rose-hulman.edu/berry123/), Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and co-director of the multidisciplinary robotics program at Rose-Hulman, our lab creates innovative platforms like [**Lily∞Bot**] (https://NoireSTEMinist.com/robots) and **Ivy∞Bot** that empower students from K–16 and beyond to explore mobile robotics, coding, and human-robot interaction.  

Our mission is rooted in the belief that **representation matters** and that **robotics should be for the streets—not just the elite.** By sharing our designs freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/merl-Rose-Hulman/), we invite educators, students, and makers everywhere to **adapt, remix, and expand** our projects to change the face of STEM.  

Whether you’re an undergraduate engineer, a K–12 teacher, or a curious community builder, **MERL is your space to learn, innovate, and create with robots.**
