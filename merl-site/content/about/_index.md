At MERL, we design inclusive, open-source robotics platforms that make engineering education hands-on, affordable, and accessible to everyone.

Led by [Dr. Carlotta A. Berry](https://wordpress.rose-hulman.edu/berry123/), our lab creates innovative platforms like [Lily∞Bot](https://www.noiresteminist.com/robots) and Ivy∞Bot that empower learners from K–16 and beyond to explore mobile robotics, coding, and human-robot interaction.

Our mission is that representation matters and robotics should be for the streets — not just the elite. By sharing our designs freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/MERL-Rose-Hulman), we invite educators, students, and makers to adapt, remix, and expand our projects to change the face of STEM.
