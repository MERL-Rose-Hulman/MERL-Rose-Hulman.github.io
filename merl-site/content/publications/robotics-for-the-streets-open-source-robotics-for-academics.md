[“Robotics for the Streets: Open-Source Robotics for Academics.”]({{< relref "publications/robotics-for-the-streets-open-source-robotics-for-academics" >}})

Open-source hardware are designs that are publicly available for anyone to modify, distribute, make, or sell. Open- source software is source code that anyone can access, inspect, modify, improve, and distribute. Open-source robotics builds upon the principles of open-source software and open-source hardware. The Open-Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) has a goal to encourage research and foster technical knowledge by making it more accessible and collaborative.

The “Robotics for the Streets” project has a goal to expand open-source hardware in academia by documenting how to use it for service, teaching and research by making a library of resources for others to follow. There is a secondary goal of diversifying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) by using open- source robotics to increase access to and visibility of STEM technology for marginalized, minoritized, and under-resourced communities.

This paper will describe the design, creation and dissemination of the open-source mobile robot platform, Flower∞Bots. Flower∞Bots consist of three robots at the novice, intermediate, and expert levels including Lily∞Bot, Daisy∞Bot and Rosie∞Bot, respectively. These robots have the flexibility and modularity for modification based upon the user’s needs. The benefits of this platform include the ability to be appropriate for any level and used for a variety of use cases. This research project is a unique, novel, and innovative practice for engineering education and research because it encourages diverse perspectives and voices to contribute to the creation and improvement of technology.

It was hypothesized that this educational robotics platform will serve as a model and pathway for teachers, professors, practitioners, and STEM enthusiasts, with limited resources to engage in robotics outreach, teaching, and research. The platform and guidebook will enable teachers and academics to meet their professional development goals at a low cost.
